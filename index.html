  <div class="about-content">
    <p>Hello! I am Justin Villamor, programmer, entrpenuer, stock investor, and daytrader. But before all that, I should give you some background. I grew in a city in metro detroit and there is where I gained my burning passion for computer science, specifically the programming and software part.  At that early age of 13, is where i truly started to form my base understanding of programming and how it works. I taught myself by modding minecraft, making minecraft servers, and watching youtube videos. So i pretty much taught myself to code from minecraft. Of course that's skimming it but thats where i started and where i gained my passion for programming and helping others. From there to the end of middle school, I was completely enveloped in the world of coding. Unfortunately i got burnt out and throughtout high school I only dabbled in programming here n there. However towards junior year i regain my passion for it, because i saw everyone struggling in my programming class and all I wanted to do was help. My teacher respected me for this and "gave me the wheel" when it came to problematic kids and kids that were really struggling. Because of this, I had to force myself to that mindset again, and from there on I still have my passion for it. However there are new intrests and hobbies that have come forward when i graduated high school. Things like taxes and money came to mind, so I had to kick it into high gear. I immediately landed a factory job and poured my money into investments towards bettering my skills and investments in the stock market. From there on I learned how to day-trade and how to analyize stock indicators.
